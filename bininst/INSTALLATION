INSTALLATION
============

The easiest way of using McErlang is by installing it as a normal
Erlang library.

To install McErlang in the normal Erlang directory structure
type the line

``mcerlang_install:install().''

to the Erlang shell. Erlang should be started from the same directory
as this file ("INSTALLATION"). That is,

> erl

Erlang R14B03 (erts-5.8.4) [source] [smp:2:2] [rq:2] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.8.4  (abort with ^G)
1> mcerlang_install:install().
...

You will probably have to run erlang with super-user priviliges 
(under Unix/Linux) or administrator privileges (Windows) for
the installation to succeed.       

After restarting Erlang, you can verify the status of the McErlang installation
by typing:

> mce_app:start().

in the Erlang shell.


SCRIPTS
=======

If you are using Unix/Linux to run McErlang consider using
the shell script ``mcerl_compiler'' (located in the same directory as this
file) to start the McErlang compiler.


SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE
=====================

For the development of McErlang source code, documentation and
examples we are using the Subversion revision control system. This
means that there is a central repository where the code is located. To
get your own local copy of the repository type the following command
in a terminal window:

$ svn checkout https://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/svn/McErlang/trunk McErlang
