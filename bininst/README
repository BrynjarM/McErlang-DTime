McErlang is a model checker for programs written in the Erlang
programming language. The idea is to replace the part of the standard
Erlang runtime system that concerns distribution, concurrency and
communication with a new runtime system which simulates processes
inside the model checker, and which offers easy access to the program
state.

The model checker has been written by Lars-Åke Fredlund
and Clara Benac Earle (Facultad de Informática,
Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain) with contributions
by Hans Svensson (IT University, Gothenburg, Sweden).
