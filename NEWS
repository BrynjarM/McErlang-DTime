01/06 -- 2011:
	By default the McErlang compiler now compiles code to support "sends
as side effects". However, this is disabled at runtime. To enable it at runtime
give the option sends_are_sefs=true to McErlang.

22/06 -- 2011: 
      New verification algorithm (mce_alg_safety_rnd) which may give better results (quicker counterexamples)
      for some verifications.
      Easier installation as an Erlang library (and thus for WINDOWS), through use of an installation
      script (see README, and bininst/INSTALLATION).

20/10 -- 2010: QUICKCHECK integration, WINDOWS support, Erlang Application 

      The integration between QuickCheck and McErlang is now better documented
      in a tutorial (doc/eqc_mcerlang_tutorial.pdf); take a look!

      We have tried to make it easier to execute McErlang under Windows, 
      and to have McErlang behave as a proper Erlang application.

      To accomplish this the installation procedure has changed 
      in a tiny detail (it is necessary to first run the configure command
      to generate the Makefile that later compiles McErlang).
      See the file INSTALLATION for detailed instructions.

23/11 -- 2010:
      - Now permits HiPE Core Erlang files (".core") as input.
      Due to limitations in the Erlang compiler it is not likely that
      all Core Erlang files will be suitable as input.

      - Atoms are permitted as arguments to the functions
      mce_erl_compile:file/1 and mce_erl_compile:file/2 (compare compile:file).

      - Implementations can now be specified without options, if they
      are not needed. Example, instead of
      	  algorithm={mce_alg_safety,whatever}
      one can specify
      	  algorithm=mce_alg_safety
