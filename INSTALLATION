For the development of McErlang source code, documentation and
examples we are using the Subversion revision control system. This
means that there is a central repository where the code is located. To
get your own local copy of the repository type the following command
in a terminal window:

$ svn checkout https://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/svn/McErlang/trunk McErlang

This command will create a local copy of all the McErlang code and
examples. To compile McErlang it normally suffices to execute ``make''
in the main McErlang directory.  In the following we assume that
McErlang is installed in the directory "~/McErlang", and that you are 
using a UNIX based system:

$ cd ~/McErlang; ./configure; make

The following examples assume that you have put the directory
"McErlang/scripts" in the ``command path'' of your shell.  Consult the
manual for your command shell if you are not sure how to do this.  As
an example, if you are running a bash shell, the following piece of
text can be added to the file ".profile":

# set PATH so it includes the directory with McErlang scripts
if [ -d ~/McErlang/scripts ] ; then
    PATH=~/McErlang/scripts:"${PATH}"
fi

===============================================

Alternative Installation:

===============================================

As an alternative to including the path to the McErlang scripts in the PATH variable
one can install McErlang as a normal Erlang library. This method will likely work much
better for Windows installations of McErlang as well. In addition we make pre-compiled
McErlang distributions available (for e.g. Windows) in the web page 
https://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/trac/McErlang/wiki/downloading.

Steps:

1. Compile McErlang as above, and then
   make release

2. Install McErlang as a library:
   cd release/McErlang_version*; erl
   1> mcerlang_install:install().

For the last step to work, it may be necessary to start Erlang (erl) with super-user rights (under Unix)
or administrator rights (Windows).

More information regarding how to install McErlang as a library, including from a pre-compiled McErlang distribution,
can be found in the file bininst/INSTALLATION.
